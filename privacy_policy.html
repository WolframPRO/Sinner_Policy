<h1>Privacy Policy for Sinner</h1>
<p><i>Last updated: 30.09.2023</i></p>

<p>
    Thank you for embracing your inner sinner with Sinner. We value your privacy as much as you value your sins. Rest assured, we do not collect, store, or process any personal data. All your sinful activities are stored solely in your iCloud account, which is controlled by you and governed by Apple’s privacy policies. Please read this to understand how we handle your transgressions.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
    Sinner does not gather, store, or process any personal data. Any data, including images of your sinful acts or any other unholy records, is stored exclusively in your iCloud account. Apple’s privacy policies govern this data storage.
</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
    Since no data is collected, Sinner does not access, use, or analyze your nefarious deeds. All your sinful actions, such as logging your transgressions or tracking your moral descent, are done locally and stored safely within your iCloud.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
    We do not retain any of your sinful data. All records are safely tucked away in your iCloud, where they are managed by you according to your iCloud settings, and not by us.
</p>

<h2>4. Security</h2>
<p>
    Your data is secured by the mighty Apple iCloud. Sinner has no access to your sinful records, which remain entirely under your control within iCloud. So no worries about your sins getting exposed—unless you choose to share them.
</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
<p>
    Since we don’t collect or store any of your data, there’s no personal information for us to modify or delete. You hold the keys to your own sinful secrets through your iCloud account.
</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
    While we might update this Privacy Policy occasionally, you won’t need to worry about changes to data handling because, well, we don’t handle any data! Keep an eye on this page for any updates.
</p>

<h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns about your sins—or our privacy policy—feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:mister.vladika@gmail.com">mister.vladika@gmail.com</a>.
    Just a reminder: The author of this app cannot absolve your sins, nor are they responsible for them.
